# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects
## Data Science
- APIs + Json
- Sorting Algorithms (Gnome Sort)
- Understanding Pandas functionality and use

## Machine Learning
### Supervised Learning - teaching/training a model with labeled or known data
- **Classification**
   - Classifying a particular object based on different specific attributes
     - Ex: Training a model to recognize an orange because its attributes are orange and round
- Linear Regression
    - Predicting the value of a variable based on the value of another variable
        - Ex: Predicting someone's salary based on the years of work experience they have
- Logistic Regression
- Multiple Regression
### Unsupervised Learning - teaching/training a model with unknown data
- Reinforcement Learning
- K-means Clustering
