# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects
## Data Science
- APIs + Json
- Sorting Algorithms (Gnome Sort)
- Understanding Pandas functionality and use

## Machine Learning
### Supervised Learning - teaching/training a model with labeled or known data
- **Classification**
   - Classifying a particular object based on different specific attributes
     
- Linear Regression
    - Predicting the value of a variable based on the value of another variable
        - Ex: Predicting someone's salary based on the years of work experience they have
- Logistic Regression
     -  calculating the probability of a binary event occurring
          - Ex: Predicting whether a person survived the Titanic sinking
          - Ex: Predicting whether an email is spam or not spam
- Multiple Regression
     - Predicting the value of a variable based on the values of multiple variables
          - Ex: Predicting the rent of an apartment based on its size, location, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms
          - Ex: Predicting the popularity of a song based on its artist, producer, tempo, variance, beat, etc.
### Unsupervised Learning - teaching/training a model with unknown data
- Reinforcement Learning
- K-means Clustering
