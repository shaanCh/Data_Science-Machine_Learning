# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects
## Data Science
- APIs + Json
- Sorting Algorithms (Gnome Sort)
- Understanding Pandas functionality and use

## Machine Learning
### Supervised Learning - teaching/training a model with labeled or known data
- **Classification**
   - Classifying a particular object based on different specific attributes
   - K-Nearest Neighbors
        - uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point
        - Ex: Classifying an orange as an orange because its attributes are closer to all the other data points that were classified as an orange
   - Naïve Bayes
        - Using probability to classify
        - Ex: Determining whether an email is spam
     
- **Linear Regression**
    - Predicting the value of a variable based on the value of another variable
        - Ex: Predicting someone's salary based on the years of work experience they have
- **Logistic Regression**
     -  calculating the probability of a binary event occurring
          - Ex: Predicting whether a person survived the Titanic sinking
- **Multiple Regression**
     - Predicting the value of a variable based on the values of multiple variables
          - Ex: Predicting the rent of an apartment based on its size, location, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms
          - Ex: Predicting the popularity of a song based on its artist, producer, tempo, variance, beat, etc.
### Unsupervised Learning - teaching/training a model with unknown data
- **Reinforcement Learning**
     - a self-teaching model that essentially learns by trial and error or a reward system
     - Q-Learning
          - Uses a specific formula that will find the best course of action, given the current state of the agent
               - Ex: Training a model to navigate through a 5x5 image of a maze
     - K-means Clustering
          - Grouping unlabeled data into clusters of similar qualities in order to determine the correct label
               - Ex: Companies can target specific groups of customers for different campaigns

## Projects
Neural Network
- MNIST dataset of 60,000 small square 28×28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9

**Task**: classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9
