- Understanding Pandas functionality and use

## Machine Learning
### Supervised Learning - teaching/training a model with labeled or known data
- **Classification**
   - Classifying a particular object based on different specific attributes
     
- Linear Regression
    - Predicting the value of a variable based on the value of another variable
        - Ex: Predicting someone's salary based on the years of work experience they have
- Logistic Regression
     -  calculating the probability of a binary event occurring
          - Ex: Predicting whether a person survived the Titanic sinking
          - Ex: Predicting whether an email is spam or not spam
- Multiple Regression
     - Predicting the value of a variable based on the values of multiple variables
          - Ex: Predicting the rent of an apartment based on its size, location, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms
          - Ex: Predicting the popularity of a song based on its artist, producer, tempo, variance, beat, etc.
### Unsupervised Learning - teaching/training a model with unknown data
- Reinforcement Learning
     - a self-teaching model that essentially learns by trial and error or a reward system
     - Q-Learning
          - Uses a specific formula that will find the best course of action, given the current state of the agent
               - Ex: Training a model to navigate through a 5x5 image of a maze
     - K-means Clustering
          - Grouping unlabeled data into clusters of similar qualities in order to determine the correct label
               - Ex:
